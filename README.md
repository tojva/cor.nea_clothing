Hi!

This is a project I did for my friend's self-customized clothes and accessories. It is supposed to present the different pieces, provide information and background about the idea and contact information. 

Some images and videos are connected to this Google Drive folder and needs to be downloaded manually:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T5Yu7eValKU5d3dW0QRDPWwKtI7sgSa-?usp=sharing 

They have the same name as in the HTML file and should be put into the img/ folder.
